Rick and Morty Portal UnleashX Skin

Thanks for downloading my Rick and Morty Portal skin for UnleashX. Should just be as simple as downloading the zip, extract it,
and put it in the "Skins" folder on the appropriate partition. Original artwork it NOT mine, it is made of a backgroud image and
portal .gif I found searching google. The menu colors still need changed from default, but you can modify the skin.xml file to put
whatever colors in you like. You can even change the monitored items on the home screen in the same .xml file.
